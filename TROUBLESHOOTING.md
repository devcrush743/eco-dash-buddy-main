# Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **Fixed Issues**

### ‚úÖ **1. Image Processing Stack Overflow**
**Problem**: `Maximum call stack size exceeded` in `imageUtils.ts`

**Solution**: Fixed recursive function call in image stamping utility. The issue was in lines 92-94 where `img.onload` was calling itself recursively.

**What was changed**:
- Removed recursive call to `img.onload()`
- Moved `URL.revokeObjectURL()` to proper locations
- Added proper error handling

### ‚úÖ **2. Firestore Permission Issues**
**Problem**: `400 error` when uploading reports to Firestore

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Created permissive Firestore rules** (`firestore.rules`)
2. **Created Storage rules** (`storage.rules`)
3. **Added error handling** for user stats updates
4. **Made stats update optional** (won't fail entire operation)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Firebase Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Apply Firestore Rules**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/swachhsaarthi)
2. Click **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules**
3. Copy the content from `firestore.rules` file
4. Click **Publish**

### **Step 2: Apply Storage Rules**
1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Rules**
2. Copy the content from `storage.rules` file
3. Click **Publish**

### **Step 3: Enable Storage**
1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Get started**
2. Choose **Start in test mode**
3. Select your preferred location
4. Click **Done**

### **Step 4: Test the Fix**
1. Refresh your browser
2. Try submitting a report with photo
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

### **Check Browser Console**
```javascript
// Open Developer Tools (F12) and run:
console.log('Firebase Auth:', firebase.auth().currentUser);
console.log('Firestore:', firebase.firestore().app.name);
```

### **Verify Permissions**
1. **Location**: Browser should prompt for location access
2. **Camera**: Should be able to select/take photos
3. **Firebase**: Should see successful uploads in console

### **Common Error Messages & Solutions**

#### **"Permission denied" (Firestore)**
```
Solution: Apply the firestore.rules from the project
Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Publish
```

#### **"Storage object does not exist"**
```
Solution: Enable Firebase Storage
Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Get started
```

#### **"Failed to get location"**
```
Solution: Allow location access in browser
Click the location icon in address bar ‚Üí Allow
```

#### **"Failed to load image"**
```
Solution: Try with a different image format
Supported: JPEG, PNG, WebP (max 10MB)
```

## üîß **Development Tools**

### **Firebase Emulator (Optional)**
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize emulators
firebase init emulators

# Start local development
firebase emulators:start
```

### **Console Debugging**
```javascript
// Test Firebase connection
console.log('Auth state:', firebase.auth().currentUser);
console.log('App name:', firebase.app().name);

// Test image processing
import { stampImageWithMeta } from './src/utils/imageUtils';
// Use in browser console to debug image issues
```

## üìã **Production Checklist**

Before going live:
- [ ] Update Firestore rules with proper security
- [ ] Update Storage rules with size limits
- [ ] Enable Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Test with real devices
- [ ] Verify all permissions work
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Performance optimization

## üí° **Performance Tips**

### **Image Optimization**
- Images are automatically compressed to reduce upload time
- GPS stamping adds minimal overhead
- Use WebP format for better compression

### **Real-time Updates**
- Firestore listeners are optimized for minimal data transfer
- Updates only send changed fields
- Automatic connection management

### **Caching**
- Images are cached in browser
- Location is cached for 1 minute
- Form data persists during network issues

## üÜò **Getting Help**

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Firebase Setup**: Ensure all services are enabled
3. **Test with Different Browsers**: Chrome works best with Firebase
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes helps with configuration issues
5. **Try Incognito Mode**: Eliminates extension conflicts

The system should now work smoothly without the stack overflow error and with proper Firebase permissions! üéâ
