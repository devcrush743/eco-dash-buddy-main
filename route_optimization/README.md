## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from route_optimization import RouteOptimizer, PickupPoint, Driver, PriorityFlag

# Create optimizer
optimizer = RouteOptimizer(google_maps_api_key="your_api_key")

# Define pickup points
pickup_points = [
    PickupPoint("P1", 28.6139, 77.2090, PriorityFlag.RED, 2.5),
    PickupPoint("P2", 28.6140, 77.2095, PriorityFlag.YELLOW, 1.8),
    PickupPoint("P3", 28.6141, 77.2100, PriorityFlag.GREEN, 1.2),
]

# Define drivers
drivers = [
    Driver("D1", 28.6130, 77.2080, max_capacity=50.0),
    Driver("D2", 28.6150, 77.2100, max_capacity=45.0),
]

# Optimize routes
result = optimizer.optimize_routes(
    pickup_points=pickup_points,
    drivers=drivers,
    priority_weight=0.4,    # 40% weight for priority coverage
    distance_weight=0.4,    # 40% weight for distance efficiency
    balance_weight=0.2      # 20% weight for workload balance
)

# Access results
print(f"Total distance: {result.total_distance:.1f} km")
print(f"Total time: {result.total_time:.0f} minutes")
print(f"Priority coverage: {result.total_red_covered}R/{result.total_yellow_covered}Y/{result.total_green_covered}G")
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Optimization Weights
Control the balance between different optimization objectives:

- **Priority Weight (0-1)**: Emphasis on covering high-priority (red/yellow) locations first
- **Distance Weight (0-1)**: Emphasis on minimizing total travel distance
- **Balance Weight (0-1)**: Emphasis on equal workload distribution across drivers

*Note: Weights must sum to 1.0*

### Google Maps API
For accurate road distances and real-time traffic:
1. Get API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Enable Distance Matrix API
3. Pass key to `RouteOptimizer(google_maps_api_key="your_key")`

Without API key, the system uses Haversine distance with road factor estimation.

## üìä Optimization Process

### Step 1: Clustering
1. **Feature Preparation**: Normalize geographic coordinates, volume, and priority
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Group points into driver-sized clusters
3. **Driver Assignment**: Optimize cluster-to-driver mapping based on base locations
4. **Balance Analysis**: Ensure workload distribution meets balance requirements

### Step 2: Route Optimization
1. **Priority Sorting**: Within each cluster, sort by priority (red > yellow > green)
2. **VRP Solving**: Use OR-Tools to optimize visit sequence
3. **Capacity Constraints**: Respect driver vehicle capacity limits
4. **Distance Minimization**: Find shortest path through priority-sorted points

### Step 3: Quality Assessment
1. **Coverage Analysis**: Verify all priority points are covered
2. **Efficiency Scoring**: Compare actual vs. optimal distances
3. **Balance Scoring**: Measure workload distribution equality
4. **Overall Scoring**: Weighted combination of all metrics

## üì± Mobile Integration

### Export for Driver Apps
```python
mobile_routes = optimizer.export_routes_for_drivers(result)

# Each driver gets:
{
    "driver_id": "DRV001",
    "driver_name": "Rajesh Kumar",
    "base_location": {"lat": 28.6130, "lng": 77.2080},
    "route_summary": {
        "total_stops": 5,
        "total_distance_km": 12.3,
        "estimated_time_minutes": 45,
        "capacity_utilization_percent": 78.5
    },
    "stops": [
        {
            "stop_number": 1,
            "pickup_id": "P001",
            "location": {"lat": 28.6139, "lng": 77.2090},
            "priority": "red",
            "volume_m3": 2.5,
            "navigation_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=28.6139,77.2090"
        }
        // ... more stops
    ]
}
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive example:
```bash
python route_optimization/example_usage.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Basic optimization with sample Ghaziabad data
- Convenience function usage
- Mobile app export format
- Driver assignment suggestions

## üöÄ Performance

### Scalability
- **Small datasets** (< 50 points, < 10 drivers): < 1 second
- **Medium datasets** (50-200 points, 10-20 drivers): 1-10 seconds  
- **Large datasets** (200+ points, 20+ drivers): 10-60 seconds

### Optimization Quality
- **Priority Coverage**: Typically 95%+ of red flags covered first
- **Distance Efficiency**: Usually 15-30% better than manual routing
- **Workload Balance**: Standard deviation typically < 20% of mean

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Priority Handling
```python
# Adjust priority penalties in route_solver.py
def _calculate_skip_penalty(self, point: PickupPoint) -> int:
    priority_multipliers = {
        PriorityFlag.RED: 10.0,    # Very high penalty
        PriorityFlag.YELLOW: 5.0,  # Medium penalty  
        PriorityFlag.GREEN: 1.0    # Low penalty
    }
    return int(base_penalty * priority_multipliers[point.priority_flag])
```

### Custom Distance Calculation
```python
# Extend DistanceCalculator for specialized needs
class CustomDistanceCalculator(DistanceCalculator):
    def road_distance(self, lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2):
        # Your custom distance logic
        return custom_distance
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
```python
# Convert from your data format
def convert_from_firestore(firestore_data):
    pickup_points = []
    for doc in firestore_data:
        point = PickupPoint(
            pickup_id=doc['id'],
            lat=doc['coords']['lat'],
            lng=doc['coords']['lng'],
            priority_flag=PriorityFlag(doc['priority']),
            volume=doc['volume']
        )
        pickup_points.append(point)
    return pickup_points
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Google Maps API Errors**
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify Distance Matrix API is enabled
   - Monitor API quotas and billing

2. **OR-Tools Installation**
   - Ensure compatible Python version (3.7+)
   - Try: `pip install --upgrade ortools`

3. **Memory Issues with Large Datasets**
   - Reduce batch sizes in distance calculations
   - Consider geographic pre-filtering
   - Use pagination for very large datasets

4. **Poor Optimization Results**
   - Adjust optimization weights
   - Check data quality (coordinates, priorities)
   - Increase OR-Tools time limits

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Traffic Integration**: Dynamic route updates based on current traffic
- **Multi-day Planning**: Optimize routes across multiple days
- **Driver Preferences**: Account for driver skill levels and preferences
- **Vehicle Constraints**: Different vehicle types with varying capabilities
- **Time Windows**: Pickup time constraints and driver schedules
