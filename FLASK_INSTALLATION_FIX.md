# Flask Installation Fix

## Problem
The build was failing during the installation of dependencies due to an error related to the Flask package version `2.3.3` specified in `requirements.txt`.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Exact version pinning**: Using `Flask==2.3.3` made the installation brittle
2. **Missing dependency**: `Werkzeug>=2.3.7` was not explicitly specified, which is required by Flask 2.3.3
3. **Version conflicts**: Exact version pinning can cause conflicts with other dependencies

## Solution Applied

### Updated `requirements.txt`
Changed from exact version pinning to flexible version ranges:

**Before:**
```
Flask==2.3.3
Flask-CORS==4.0.0
scikit-learn==1.3.0
numpy==1.24.3
requests==2.31.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
```

**After:**
```
Flask>=2.3.0,<3.0.0
Flask-CORS>=4.0.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.24.0
requests>=2.31.0
gunicorn>=21.0.0
Werkzeug>=2.3.7
```

### Key Changes
1. **Flexible Flask version**: `Flask>=2.3.0,<3.0.0` allows pip to install the latest compatible version
2. **Added Werkzeug**: Explicitly specified `Werkzeug>=2.3.7` as required by Flask 2.3.3+
3. **Flexible other dependencies**: Changed from exact versions to minimum versions for better compatibility
4. **Added gunicorn**: Included gunicorn in requirements for production deployment

## Benefits
- ✅ **More resilient**: Flexible version ranges prevent installation failures
- ✅ **Better compatibility**: Allows pip to resolve dependency conflicts automatically
- ✅ **Future-proof**: Compatible with newer versions of dependencies
- ✅ **Production-ready**: Includes all necessary dependencies for deployment

## Testing
The fix was tested using:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --dry-run -r requirements.txt
```

Result: ✅ All packages resolved successfully without conflicts.

## Documentation Updated
- Updated `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with the new requirements.txt format
- All deployment guides now reference the corrected Flask version specification

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated `requirements.txt` to your hosting platform
2. The build should now complete successfully
3. Monitor the deployment logs to confirm Flask installation works
