## Usage Examples

### Basic Responsive Classes
```tsx

<h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl">

// Responsive grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

// Responsive spacing
<div className="p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8">
```

### Using Responsive Hooks
```tsx
import { useIsMobile, useBreakpoint } from "@/hooks/use-mobile";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const isMobile = useIsMobile();
  const breakpoint = useBreakpoint();
  
  return (
    <div className={isMobile ? "mobile-layout" : "desktop-layout"}>
      Current breakpoint: {breakpoint}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This responsive design implementation ensures the Swatch Saarthi application provides an optimal user experience across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
